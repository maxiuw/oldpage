I am a Ph.D. student supervised by Patric Jensfelt and Andre Pereira. My doctoral studies are supported by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP).

I am working on projects focused on computer vision solutions for 3D perception and dynamic environment understanding. I also create VR/AR applications for improving human interaction with indoor and outdoor robots.

I would be more than happy to supervise master's students who would be interested in working with me on one of my projects
