I am a Ph.D. student supervised by Patric Jensfelt and Andr√© Pereira. My doctoral studies are supported by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) track.
<br/><br/>

I am working on projects using deep learning and computer vision for 3D perception and dynamic environment understanding. I am also creating VR/AR applications for improving human interaction with indoor and outdoor robots.
<br/><br/>

I would be more than happy to supervise master's students who would be interested in working with me on one of my projects.
