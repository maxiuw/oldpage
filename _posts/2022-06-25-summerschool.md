13â€“17 June, the division of Robotics, Perception and Learning held their first summer school for doctoral students and postdocs. Researchers from all over the world got the opportunity to learn and collaborate in the inspiring environment at Happy Tammsvik, outside of Stockholm. Even though this was their first year of organising, the event got stunning reviews and has already resulted in multiple new research projects.

During the pandemic, the opportunity to collaborate and take note of each other's research has been minimal. So, at the request of the management, a committee from the RPL division organized a summer school. They attracted 85 attending doctoral students and postdocs from 34 different institutes via invites.
